## [Forage: British Airways Virtual Experience Program](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/NjynCWzGSaWXQCxSX?ref=vAuarJSrf78XvNdes)

This repository contains the code for the virtual internship program offered by Forage in collaboration with British Airways. The program consists of two tasks, which are explained below.

### Task 1: Scrape and Analyze Customer Review Data

In this task, we scraped customer review data from the web and analyzed it to uncover findings for British Airways. We used the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and Pandas and Matplotlib for exploratory data analysis. Additionally, we utilized Python's Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews.

### Task 2: Build a Predictive Model for Buying Behaviors

In this task, we built a predictive model to understand the factors that influence buying behaviors for British Airways. We used scikit-learn to build various predictive models and validate the results.

### Tools Used

- BeautifulSoup for web scraping
- Pandas and Matplotlib for exploratory data analysis
- Python's Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) for sentiment analysis
- Scikit-learn for building and validating predictive models

### How to Run the Code

To run the code, you will need to install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can do this by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the individual scripts for each task. The scripts are located in the `task1` and `task2` directories respectively.

### Conclusion

This virtual experience program provided a great opportunity to gain hands-on experience in data analysis and predictive modeling. We hope that the code in this repository can be useful for others who are interested in similar projects.
